# Ration.io – Real-Time Ration Shop Stock Information System

Ration.io is a smart and inclusive solution designed to transform India's Public Distribution System (PDS) by providing **real-time stock availability** of essential commodities through an **Interactive Voice Response (IVR)** system and a secure **web platform**.

## 📌 Problem Statement

India’s PDS is vital for food security, yet suffers from:

- Long queues at ration shops
- Wasted customer time due to unavailable stock
- Lack of real-time updates
- Exclusion of illiterate users in text-based systems

Ration.io solves this by offering an accessible voice-based solution combined with a digital interface for shopkeepers.

## 🧠 How It Works

### ☎️ IVR Workflow
1. Customer calls the local ration shop's number.
2. Asterisk-powered IVR plays a pre-recorded message:
   - Lists available commodities
   - Informs shop opening/closing times
3. Customer navigates options using keypad input.

### 🌐 Web Platform Workflow
1. Shopkeeper logs in via secure web portal.
2. Updates stock availability and timing info.
3. Changes are synced to the central database.
4. IVR system pulls updated info and serves it to callers in real time.
